speedyGApy
==========

A numpy + matplotlib based port of [speedyGA](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15164) to Python. 

SpeedyGApy isn't meant to be all things to all people. Instead, it's a single-file, barebones, highly vectorized 
genetic algorithm with uniform crossover (UX), sigma scaling, and stochastic universal sampling that rips. 

Since it's a single file it's easy to adapt it to fit your engineering needs. Just modify the parameter settings 
and fitness function that's currently being used (4-bit stochastic effective attribute parity).

It can also be used to confirm a new explanation for optimization in genetic algorithms with UX proposed [here](http://blog.hackingevolution.net/2013/01/20/foga-2013-slides/) 

Enjoy!
